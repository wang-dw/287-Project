Creating a classic game of Snake.

Rough Plan

	Figure out how to display an image from the de2 board to a monitor

	Create an object 1 to be displayed on the monitor and make it move
	inside the screen using the 4 buttons on the de2 board. Create object 2
	that will randomly appear on the screen.

3rd: Set up parameters:

     Increase size of object 1
     Game over when object 1 touches the screen edge
     Game over when object 1 touches itself
